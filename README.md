# Overview

This was a task to get a handle on C#.

I wrote a semi-basic tic-tac-toe program. 

Given that I have mainly worked with C++ and Python, I wanted to learn a bit more about this language and feel the scope provided. It was a bit tedious but felt similar enough and
at times easier than other languages I have worked with. I worked a fair bit on another project in a private directory, and luckily the two coinsided with generalistic behavior.
